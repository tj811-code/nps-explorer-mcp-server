# NPS Explorer MCP Server 🔭
## Overview

This repository is a modified version of Cloudflare’s [remote-MCP-GitHub-OAuth demo](https://github.com/cloudflare/ai/tree/main/demos/remote-mcp-github-oauth#readme), extended into a **National Parks Service Explorer**. It provides an LLM context on U.S. national parks by integrating:

- The **National Park Service API**  
- The **Recreation.gov API**  
- A **Weather API (I chose [https://www.weatherapi.com/](https://www.weatherapi.com/))**  

It runs as a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server on Cloudflare Workers, letting you query park overviews, trails, alerts, events, weather forecasts, and more via simple tool calls to the LLM.

## 📋 Prerequisites

- A Cloudflare account with Workers and KV enabled  
- Node.js v18.20.4+ and npm  
- Your own API keys for:  
  - National Park Service API  
  - Recreation.gov API  
  - Weather API ([weatherapi](https://www.weatherapi.com/))  

---

## ⚙️ Setup

1. **Clone this repo**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Kyle-Ski/nps-explorer-mcp-server.git
   cd nps-explorer-mcp-server
   ```

2. **Copy and fill `.dev.vars`**  
   ```bash
   cp .dev.vars.example .dev.vars
   ```
   _Then open .dev.vars and populate with your own secrets._
  * [NPS API]( https://www.nps.gov/subjects/developer/api-documentation.htm)
  * [rec.gov API](https://ridb.recreation.gov/docs)
  * [Weather API (or whatever you choose)](https://www.weatherapi.com/)
  * [Create a GitHub OAuth App](https://github.com/settings/applications/new)

3. **Install dependencies**  
  ```bash
  npm i
  ```

4. **(Recommended) Use a Weather Proxy**

To avoid sending WeatherAPI keys from this worker's outbound URLs, deploy a separate proxy worker using `examples/weather-proxy-worker.ts` and set:

```bash
WEATHER_PROXY_BASE_URL=https://your-weather-proxy.example.workers.dev
WEATHER_PROXY_BEARER_TOKEN=<strong-random-token>
WEATHER_PROXY_SIGNING_SECRET=<another-strong-random-secret>
REQUIRE_WEATHER_PROXY=true
```

The MCP worker will then call your proxy and the proxy injects `WEATHER_API_KEY` server-side.

Notes:
- `WEATHER_PROXY_BASE_URL` and `WEATHER_PROXY_BEARER_TOKEN` must be set together.
- If `REQUIRE_WEATHER_PROXY=true`, startup fails unless proxy vars are fully configured.
- Proxy supports optional short-lived signed requests (`X-Proxy-Timestamp`, `X-Proxy-Signature`) to reduce risk from bearer token leakage.

5. **Run Locally**
  ```bash
  npm start
  ```

## 🚀 Deployment
The `deploy` command is using [Wrangler](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/) to deploy your server to Cloudflare [Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/)! Cloudflare will also use their [Durable Objects](https://developers.cloudflare.com/durable-objects/) and [Workers KV](https://developers.cloudflare.com/kv/).

  ```bash
  npm run deploy
  ```

## 🧪 Testing
Once your server is up and running, use the [MCP Server Inspector Tool](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/tools/inspector)
to make sure your server can connect and show you the tools and resources it has access to. 
```bash
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector
```

## 🛜 For Production 
_All of this is in the original [Cloudflare README.md](https://github.com/cloudflare/ai/tree/main/demos/remote-mcp-github-oauth#readme)_  
**Cloudflare recommends creating a local and remote GitHub OAuth App:**
* For the Homepage URL, specify `https://mcp-github-oauth.<your-subdomain>.workers.dev`
* For the Authorization callback URL, specify `https://mcp-github-oauth.<your-subdomain>.workers.dev/callback`
* Note your Client ID and generate a Client secret and add them via Wrangler.
```bash
wrangler secret put GITHUB_CLIENT_ID
wrangler secret put GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET
wrangler secret put COOKIE_ENCRYPTION_KEY # add any random string here e.g. openssl rand -hex 32
```
**Set up a KV namespace**
* Create the KV namespace: wrangler kv:namespace create "OAUTH_KV"
* Update the Wrangler file with the KV ID

## 🧑‍🔧 Troubleshooting and Common Issues
_Check out the MCP [troubleshooting docs](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/tools/debugging)_  

**Connecting to Claude Desktop Fails:**
* Most commonly due to Node incompatibility issues, use node v18.20.4+ locally and checkout [this guide](https://kyle.czajkowski.tech/blog/troubleshooting-claude-s-remote-connection-to-mcp-servers) I wrote.
